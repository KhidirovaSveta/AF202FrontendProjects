      <h3> House Blend Coffee </h3>
      <img src="../01-FirstHtmlFullSite/image/house-blend.png" alt="not found" title="House Blend Coffee ">
      <p>House Blend coffee is unique to every coffee shop, every roaster, and every drinker. 
        That is what makes them so unique and so special. The blending and serving process is built entirely on the preference of the roaster and/or distributor. 
        For example, Starbucks describes their House Blend as  <i> “the very first blend we ever created for you back in 1971. 
        The one blend that set the course for the way our master blenders and roasters work even today.
        A true reflection of us and delicious cup of coffee, period.” </i></p>

      <h3> French Roast </h3>
      <img src="../01-FirstHtmlFullSite/image/French-roast.png" alt="not found" title="French Roast">
      <p>Simply put, <i>“French roast”</i> describes the color of the coffee beans after they have been roasted.
        These beans are on the darker end of the scale, and are usually the color of dark chocolate. 
        It does not mean the coffee was grown or roasted in France (although yes, that is where the roasting style originated in the 1800s).
        The name is believed to reflect the tastes and traditions of coffee roasters in Europe in the 19th century, where dark-roasted coffee was all the rage. </p>

      <h3> Colombian Roast </h3>
      <img src="../01-FirstHtmlFullSite/image/Colombian-roast.png" alt="not found" title="Columbian Roast">
      <p>Colombia is famous for growing some of the best coffee beans in the world; the plants thrive under the shade of banana trees in the tropical climate.
        Because of Colombia’s high altitude, it also shapes the way the bean grows.
        Colombia is actually a near-perfect coffee growing climate, and Colombian coffee produces a specific type of bean that results from the environment. </p>
